# Java PhotoViewer class


I programmed for grade B. My PhotoViewer class contains CircularLinked list implementation and Node implementation. The Node represents a single image, and CircularLinkedList represents a whole album. I put my images in a folder called ‘images’. So the call should be java PhotoViewer "images"


This Java application is a simple photo viewer that displays images from a specified directory in a loop, using a custom circular linked list to manage the images. Users can navigate through the images using a "Next" button. When the last image is reached, it loops back to the first image. The displayed images are scaled to a resolution of 700x500 pixels.


Run the application with the path to a folder containing images as an argument. The application window will open, displaying the first image. The application will loop back to the first image after the last one. I used an idea from ChatGPT for a better design of my program on lines 27 and 43  and commented on the source. I also visited Chandanas office hours on Monday. Please be patient after you click the 'next' button. It takes a few seconds for the new image to appear.
